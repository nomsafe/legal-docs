# Nomsafe Privacy Policy
At Nomsafe, we respect your privacy and take great care in protecting your Personal Information. This policy demonstrates our commitment to your privacy. Read on to discover how your Personal Information is being protected.

## A. Scope & Interpretation
This policy applies to Nomsafe.
In this policy, we explain what Personal Information we collect, and how we use, share and manage it.
Please not that when you use one of our applications, additional terms and conditions may be provided regarding the collection, use or sharing of Personal Information in connection with that that application. Those terms and conditions will apply together with this policy.

### Personal Information
"Personal Information" as used in this policy means information about an identifiable individual, such as the name and email of that individual, and includes non-personal information that we link to Personal Information.

### What Personal Information is Not
This policy does not cover non-personal information, which is information that does no identify you. However, as stated above, when we collect non-personal information and link that non-personal information to an identifiable individual, then that information will become Personal Information and become subject to this policy.

## B. Consent
Unless permitted or required by law, Nomsafe will not collect, use or share Personal Information without first obtaining consent. We will obtain consent when we want to use Personal Information for a new purpose or for a purpose other than those stated at the time of collection, in this policy or in the terms and conditions of a specific product, service, program, contest, promotion or event you signed up for, participated in or purchased

Consent can be "express" through words or by specific acts or "implied" by the conduct of the individual whose Personal information is being collected, used or shared. Unless we determine that we require an additional consent for specific products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events, you agree and consent that as a provider of personal information we may collect, use, share or otherwise process your Personal Information in accordance with this policy.

You may withdraw your consent for certain purposes. For example, you may choose not to receive:

* Invitations addressed to you personally to comment on the products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events that you use or that are available to you

If you choose not to provide us with Personal Information or if you withdraw your consent, where such withdrawal is available, we may not be able to offer you the services or information that you requested or that could be offered to you.
To withdraw or limit your consent, you can contact us as described below in "Answering Your Privacy Questions". 
Please not that it may take some time for all of our records to reflect changes in your preferences.

## C. How We Collect Personal Information
### Collection of Non-Personally-Identifying Information: Activity and Log Data
Like most applications, NomSafe automatically collects and stores non-personally-identifying information related to your use of the Services. We log the products you scan and view, the frequency and type of alternative products you choose to view, and other actions you perform while using NomSafe services. We use this information to refine how we can best meet your needs in using our Services. From time to time, we may also release **non-personally-identifying** in the aggregate to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure the interest in and use of NomSafe Services. You can stop all collection of non-personally identifying information by uninstalling the application on your mobile device.

### Collection of Personally-Identifying Information: User Accounts, Email, and Contributed Photos
In certain circumstances, you may choose to interact with NomSafe in ways that require us to obtain certain types of personally-identifying information. The amount and type of personal information we ask for depends on the nature of the interaction. NomSafe will only collect such information as necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the User's requested interaction with NomSafe. We will not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described or stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy. You are always able to refuse supplying personally-identifying information to us if you do not feel comfortable doing so, but you must acknowledge that it may prevent you from engaging in certain Services offered by NomSafe.

## D. How We Use Personal Information
We identify the purpose for which Personal Information will be used typically at or before the time the Personal Information is collected. Our use of Personal Information is limited to the purposes described in this policy, the purposes set out in the terms and conditions of our application and purposes required by law. As new purposes may develop over time, we may update this policy so we encourage you to review this policy periodically online.

Information about which allergies you are allergic to will be collected in order to perform the application's functions as you are using NomSafe through your associated account. Users who do not have any allergies will not have any allergy information collected.

### Opinions
For each product, users are able to provide simple opinions in the form of tags, likes, and dislikes. This information is linked to the user and is collected by Nomsafe. Additionally, opinions are updated in real-time, meaning that this data is publicly available but anonymous to the public. By not providing any opinions on any products, no opinion information can be linked to the account.

We do not send any individualized personal information to third parties, but they may have access to information that they obtained through aggregated statistics or other information you may have shared with them yourself. NomSafe does not rent, share, or trade personally-identifying-information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. The content posted by these third parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party. We do not provide any personally-identifying-information to these third-party websites or businesses.

Nomsafe strives to maintain appropriate physical, procedural and technical safeguards in its application so as to prevent loss, misuses, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of Personal Information. Our safeguards also apply to our disposal or destruction of Personal Information. We also seek to ensure that any Personal Information in our custody is as accurate, current and complete as necessary for the purposes for which we use that Personal Information

### Where We Keep Personal Information
We store, access and use Personal Information in the United States. Unless there is a legal or regulatory requirement to keep such information in Canada, Personal Information may also be stored, accessed, or used outside Canada. Where Personal Information is located outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.

### How Long We Keep Personal Information
We actively retain Personal Information only as long as it is required for our relationship and a certain period of time afterwards to respond to queries or as required by federal and provincial laws. When this period ends, Personal Information is scheduled for destruction according to our record retention policies. Depending on the nature of the Personal Information and the purpose for which is was collected, this schedule may vary.

Our policy is to response to access requests as required by applicable laws. Nomsafe may decline access to Personal Information in certain circumstances.
