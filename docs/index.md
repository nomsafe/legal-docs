# Nomsafe Privacy Policy
At Nomsafe, we respect your privacy and take great care in protecting your Personal Information. This policy demonstrates our commitment to your privacy. Read on to discover how your Personal Information is being protected.

## A. Scope & Interpretation
This policy applies to Nomsafe.
In this policy, we explain what Personal Information we collect, and how we use, share and manage it.
Please not that when you use one of our applications, additional terms and conditions may be provided regarding the collection, use or sharing of Personal Information in connection with that that application. Those terms and conditions will apply together with this policy.

### Personal Information
"Personal Information" as used in this policy means information about an identifiable individual, such as the name and email of that individual, and includes non-personal information that we link to Personal Information.

### What Personal Information is Not
This policy does not cover non-personal information, which is information that does no identify you. However, as stated above, when we collect non-personal information and link that non-personal information to an identifiable individual, then that information will become Personal Information and become subject to this policy.

## B. Consent
Unless permitted or required by law, Nomsafe will not collect, use or share Personal Information without first obtaining consent. We will obtain consent when we want to use Personal Information for a new purpose or for a purpose other than those stated at the time of collection, in this policy or in the terms and conditions of a specific product, service, program, contest, promotion or event you signed up for, participated in or purchased

Consent can be "express" through words or by specific acts or "implied" by the conduct of the individual whose Personal information is being collected, used or shared. Unless we determine that we require an additional consent for specific products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events, you agree and consent that as a provider of personal information we may collect, use, share or otherwise process your Personal Information in accordance with this policy.

You may withdraw your consent for certain purposes. For example, you may choose not to receive:
* Information addressed to you personally about products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events offered by Nomsafe or companies with whom we have business relationships;
* Invitations addressed to you personally to comment on the products, services, programs, contests, promotions or events that you use or that are available to you

If you choose not to provide us with Personal Information or if you withdraw your consent, where such withdrawal is available, we may not be able to offer you the services or information that you requested or that could be offered to you.
To withdraw or limit your consent, you can contact us as described below in "Answering Your Privacy Questions". 
Please not that it may take some time for all of our records to reflect changes in your preferences.
